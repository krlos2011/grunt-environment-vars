# grunt-environment-vars

> Automation of reading environment from yml file and write in html files like window var

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-environment-vars --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-environment-vars');
```

## The "environment" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `environment` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({

  dir: {
    dev: '.tmp',
    dist: 'dist'
  },

  environment: {
    options: {
      file: 'environment.yml'
    },
    dev: {
      dest: ['<%= dir.dev %>/index.html']
    },
    dist: {
      dest: ['<%= dir.dist %>/index.html']
    }
  }
});
```
